#### Data Upload ####

Currently Darshak stores essential data about GSM and 3G networks in the local
database file.  Soon upload functionality will be available to upload database file from the app to central repository.

To help us improve and add features and build IMSI catcher detector profile, we request you to export database files manualy from the device and mail to darshak@sec.t-labs.tu-berlin.de.
Off course, we make this data avaialbe online for further research in mobile networks.
